DataTweaker - A Simple CSV Editor

Instructions for DataTweaker Application
------------------------------------------------------
The "pandas" Python module is a dependency for the application to run.

You can open a CSV file or simply start adding fields to create a new file.

There are plenty of useful shortcuts in the File and Edit tabs.

Field names must be unique for the first row since this row is reserved for column headings. These serve as descriptors for their respective columns.

I've provided a test.csv file with some random values, feel free to use it to get a feel for the application.

With the rise in data production, we must find an efficient means of transporting and storing this data while preserving precious bandwidth and disk space. We find the answer in .csv files. Happy tweaking.
